== Brief Introduction

I am a Master student in Machenical Engineering at the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, advised by [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shengbo-Li-2 Prof. Shengbo Eben Li].
I received the B.S. degree in Vehicle Engineering at the School of Vehicle and Mobility from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2020.

I am interested in reinforcement learning (RL) combined with optimal control, especially safe RL (where certain state constraints are imposed on the agent), and their applications to autonomous driving.

== News
- 05/2022: Our paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07536 Reachability Constrained Reinforcement Learning] was accepted for short presentation at ICML 2022. Note that the camera-ready version and codes are still in progress and will come out soon.
